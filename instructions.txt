1. As part of this demo run, we will be working on the HDFS Path = /user/au2056/tars/demo

2. The start point of the demo run would be to execute the script start.sh. A sample execution command would be

./start.sh  <working-directory> <hdfs-out-path>
		<working-directory> = base path of the demo directory. The shell script (start.sh) should be executed while in this directory.
		<hdfs-out-path> = directory in hdfs where the data will be persisted. The user need not create the directory. An example such path = "/user/au2056/bdad-tars-demo"
3. The script takes about 7-8 minutes to run end-to-end.
4. The file generate_data  contains all the python scripts to generate seed data.
5. The jar file tars_1.0.jar contains all our packaged spark jobs.



Data Directories(apart from demo)

	Base HDFS Path = /user/au2056/tars/

	Data Directories for Actual Data that we generated

	Raw Entities = /user/au2056/tars/raw
	Cleaned-up Entities = /user/au2056/tars/cleaned_up
	Watch History (multiple experiment runs) = /user/au2056/tars/experiments
	Watch History (with large counts) = /user/au2056/tars/big-base
	Statistical Insights Output = /user/au2056/tars/statistical





Now, if we want to generate the raw_data on our own, we can use the greene_script.sh 

A sample execution command would be

	./greene_script.sh <number-of-users> <number-of-videos> <scratch-directory-path> <working-directory>

	(eg: ./greene_script.sh 1000 5000 /scratch/pp2460  /home/pp2460/finals)

	<number-of-users> = number of users we want to generate as part of our demo dataset
	<number-of-videos> = number of videos we want to generate as part of our demo dataset
	<scratch-directory-path> = we create a python environment under the scratch directory with pandas (for instance, scratch/pp2460)
	<working-directory> = base path of the demo directory. The peel script (peel_script.sh) should be executed while in this directory as this 
						diirectory will store the data that is generated.(for instance, /home/pp2460/final)




Now run the peel scripts for the spark jobs:

A sample execution command would be

	./peel_script.sh <working-directory> <HDFS Path where all the result will be stored>


	<working-directory>  = same as above
	<HDFS Path where all the result will be stored> = any hdfs path where all the results will be stored

	(eg: ./peel_script.sh /home/pp2460/final /user/pp2460/tars)


Please make sure that the greene_script when executed must in the same folder as of generate_data.zip
and the peel_script when executed must in the same folder as of tars_1.0.jar
